# Release Notes

<!-- do not remove -->

## 1.0.0

### New Features

- Rewrite shell sage to use lisette ([#56](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/shell_sage/pull/56)), thanks to [@ncoop57](https://github.com/ncoop57)
  - This PR is a major rewrite of shell sage to now use lisette which make it easier to use other llm providers. Additionally, we have done away with command and agent mode and having the default mode subsume these. Added additional tools and web search as well.


## 0.1.1

### New Features

- Deep Search on your own file system ([#42](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/shell_sage/issues/42))
  - This feature would be akin to what many are calling deep search or deep research, in which an AI is given a bunch of tools where they can reason through and search for particular things either on the web or locally and then surface that information to the user in some sort of report or blob of information. However, for Shell Sage, this will be a new feature flag that will allow Shell Sage to create this tool loop for answering the particular user's question about their file system or set of files.

- Add RAG ([#25](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/shell_sage/issues/25))
