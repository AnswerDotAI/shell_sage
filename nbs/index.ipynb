    "ShellSage is designed to run within a tmux session. Here are the core commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Basic usage\n",
    "ssage hi ShellSage\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pipe content to ShellSage\n",

    "\n",
    "# Target a specific tmux pane\n",
    "ssage --pid %3 what's happening in this pane?\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Using Alternative Model Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "ShellSage supports using different LLM providers through base URL configuration. This allows you to use local models or alternative API endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Use a local Ollama endpoint\n",

    "ssage --provider openai --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 --base_url https://api.together.xyz/v1 help me with sed # make sure you've set your together API key in your shell_sage conf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful for:\n",
    "- Running models locally for privacy/offline use\n",
    "- Using alternative hosting providers\n",
    "- Testing different model implementations\n",
    "- Accessing specialized model deployments\n",
    "\n",

    "### Effective Usage Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contextual Queries**\n",
    "   - Keep your tmux pane IDs visible in the status bar\n",
    "   - Use `--pid` when referencing other panes\n",
