    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "ShellSage works by understanding your terminal context and leveraging powerful language models (Claude or GPT) to provide intelligent assistance for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shell commands and scripting\n",
    "- System administration tasks\n",
    "- Git operations\n",
    "- File management\n",
    "- Process handling\n",
    "- Real-time problem solving\n",
    "\n",
    "What sets ShellSage apart is its ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read your terminal context through tmux integration\n",
    "- Provide responses based on your current terminal state\n",
    "- Accept piped input for direct analysis\n",
    "- Target specific tmux panes for focused assistance\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Install ShellSage directly from PyPI using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install shell-sage\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Installing with `uv`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have `uv` installed then you can use its powerful `tool` feature to install ShellSage as a global CLI — safely, with per-tool isolation and no need for manual virtualenv management.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "uv tool install shell_sage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will make the `ssage` CLI available everywhere on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you also want to install additional dependencies (for example `fastlite`), you can do it at install time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "uv tool install --with fastlite shell_sage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "To upgrade ShellSage to the latest version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "uv tool upgrade shell_sage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List All Installed Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "See everything you’ve installed via `uv tool`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "uv tool list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uninstall\n",
    "\n",
    "To completely remove ShellSage and its environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "uv tool uninstall shell_sage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `uv tool` keeps ShellSage completely isolated from your project dependencies, so you can safely use `ssage` even when inside another virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Key Setup**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   # For Claude (default)\n",
    "   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk...\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # For OpenAI (optional)\n",
    "   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **tmux Configuration**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   We recommend using this optimized tmux configuration for the best ShellSage experience. Create or edit your `~/.tmux.conf`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   # Enable mouse support\n",
    "   set -g mouse on\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Show pane ID and time in status bar\n",
    "   set -g status-right '#{pane_id} | %H:%M '\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Keep terminal content visible (needed for neovim)\n",
    "   set-option -g alternate-screen off\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Enable vi mode for better copy/paste\n",
    "   set-window-option -g mode-keys vi\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Improved search and copy bindings\n",
    "   bind-key / copy-mode\\; send-key ?\n",
    "   bind-key -T copy-mode-vi y \\\n",
    "     send-key -X start-of-line\\; \\\n",
    "     send-key -X begin-selection\\; \\\n",

    "     paste-buffer\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Reload tmux config:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   tmux source ~/.tmux.conf\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration enables mouse support, displays pane IDs (crucial for targeting specific panes), maintains terminal content visibility, and adds vim-style keybindings for efficient navigation and text selection."

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "ShellSage is designed to run within a tmux session. Here are the core commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Basic usage\n",
    "ssage hi ShellSage\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pipe content to ShellSage\n",
    "cat error.log | ssage explain this error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Target a specific tmux pane\n",
    "ssage --pid %3 what is happening in this pane?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Automatically fill in the command to run\n",
    "ssage --c how can I list all files including the hidden ones?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log the model, timestamp, query and response to a local SQLite database\n",
    "ssage --log \"how can i remove the file\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--pid` flag is particularly useful when you want to analyze content from a different pane. The pane ID is visible in your tmux status bar (configured earlier).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--log` option saves log data to an SQLite database located at `~/.shell_sage/log_db/logs.db`."

    "### Using Alternative Model Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "ShellSage supports using different LLM providers through base URL configuration. This allows you to use local models or alternative API endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Use a local Ollama endpoint\n",
    "ssage --provider openai --model llama3.2 --base_url http://localhost:11434/v1 --api_key ollama what is rsync?\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running models locally for privacy/offline use\n",
    "- Using alternative hosting providers\n",
    "- Testing different model implementations\n",
    "- Accessing specialized model deployments\n",
