    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Install ShellSage directly from PyPI using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "uv pip install shell-sage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Key Setup**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   # For Claude (default)\n",
    "   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk...\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # For OpenAI (optional)\n",
    "   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **tmux Configuration**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   I created a preconfigured [tmux configuration](.tmux.conf) that I found works well with shell sage. It enables things like mouse support, adds pane ids to your status bar so you can quickly reference them to have ShellSage read from them, turns off alternative-screen so editor content like vim will stay in the tmux buffer for ShellSage to see, and adds a shortcut for automatically extracting out code fence blocks into your command prompt (CTRL+B+E then the index of the code fence block you want)."

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your First Command\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, try ShellSage with a simple greeting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "ssage hi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is properly setup, you should see a welcoming greeting back from ShellSage!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Help with Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic use case is asking about shell commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "ssage how do I list all files including hidden ones? # note if you are using zsh, you will need to wrap prompts in quotes that include ?\n",
    "ssage explain what rsync does\n",
    "ssage show me tar command examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ShellSage will provide the command, explain how it works, and give you practical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Terminal Context\n",
    "\n",
    "ShellSage automatically reads your tmux history to understand what you're working on:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# After running some commands that produced errors\n",
    "ssage what went wrong with my last command?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get suggestions based on your workflow\n",
    "ssage what should I do next?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Piping Content for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One of ShellSage's most powerful features is analyzing piped input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Understand error messages\n",
    "cat error.log | ssage explain this error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Review code changes\n",
    "git diff | ssage summarize these changes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analyze system logs\n",
    "journalctl -xe | ssage what's causing these errors?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Multiple Tmux Panes\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have multiple panes open, you can reference specific ones by their ID (shown in your status bar):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Analyze what's happening in pane %2\n",
    "ssage --pid %2 what is this process doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compare across all panes\n",
    "ssage --pid all summarize what's happening in all my panes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting and Running Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "When ShellSage suggests commands, you can extract them directly to your command line. First, enable logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "ssage --log how do I find large files?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ShellSage will respond with code blocks. Press `Ctrl+B E` then enter the index number (0 for first block, 1 for second, etc.) to send that command directly to your prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling Sassy Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more entertaining experience, try sassy mode (GLaDOS-inspired):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "ssage --mode sassy explain git rebase\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you're familiar with the basics:\n",
    "- Try piping different types of content to ShellSage\n",
    "- Experiment with the `--pid` flag to analyze different panes\n",
    "- Enable logging with `--log` to use the code extraction feature\n",
    "- Check out the Configuration section to customize your experience"

    "\n",
    "### Using Different Model Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "ShellSage uses [lisette](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/lisette) under the hood, which supports any LLM provider via [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers). This means you can use Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models via Ollama, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local Models with Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "For privacy-conscious users or offline usage, run models locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# First, install and start Ollama, then pull a model\n",
    "ollama pull qwen3:1.7b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use with ShellSage\n",
    "ssage --model ollama_chat/qwen3:1.7b how do I compress a directory?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or set as default in your config.toml\n",
    "model = \"ollama_chat/qwen3:1.7b\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here\n",
    "ssage --model gpt-5 explain kubernetes pods\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here\n",
    "ssage --model gemini/gemini-pro what is systemd?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "For any provider supported by LiteLLM, set the appropriate API key and use the provider's model format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Custom API base\n",
    "ssage --api-base https://your-api.com --api-key your_key --model your_model your query\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [LiteLLM providers documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) for the complete list of supported providers and their model naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Line Overrides\n",
    "\n",
    "Any configuration option can be temporarily overridden via command line arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Use a different model for one query\n",
    "ssage --model gpt-5 explain this error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adjust history lines\n",
    "ssage --history-lines 100 what commands did I just run?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enable logging for this prompt\n",
    "ssage --log how do I find large files?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Change the display theme\n",
    "ssage --code-theme dracula --code-lexer python show me a python example\n",
